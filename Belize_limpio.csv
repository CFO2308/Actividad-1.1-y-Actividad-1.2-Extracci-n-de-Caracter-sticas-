Our neighborhood is safe and you will feel comfortable walking around no matter if it is day or night. We have bars and restaurants close by in walking distance. We are located near the airstrip, However, we are at the sweet spot where the planes have either already taken off or are coasting in for their landing, so it is pretty quiet, considering. For those that prefer a gym to the beach for a work out, it is just down the road from us and day passes to the pool are available for our guests!<br /><br />*Please note that we are not on the beach -  especially when you are reviewing the property ""Location"" category after your stay. We work really hard to do everything we can to ensure that all our reviews are 5 stars in all categories in order to keep our Superhost rating; but we cannot change our location on the island.

We are a quick 20 minute golf cart ride (and even shorter boat ride) to and from town, making it easy to go to town for shopping or dinner. However, there are several great restaurants and bars within walking distance (like Rojo Lounge, Sundiver Bar, Mambos at Mata Chica, etc.), and once you experience the peace and serenity that Still Waters offers, you may find yourself not wanting to leave the property!

Because we are close to the reef, there can be seagrass that washes in. However - the swimmable beaches we have - are gorgeous. All beaches in Belize are public, so you are welcome to walk freely on all the beachfront. Although many resorts are located on the beach, there are only a few spots people actually swim in the sea.

Because we are close to the reef, there can be seagrass that washes in. However - the swimmable beaches we have - are gorgeous. All beaches in Belize are public, so you are welcome to walk freely on all the beachfront. Although many resorts are located on the beach, there are only a few spots people actually swim in the sea. Here are the popular spots to swim: <br />--You can walk right to the shore, steps away, from PUR, and walk the beautiful, picturesque beach front<br />--You can swim off the docks at Rum dog, just minutes walk away, head north on the beach <br />-- Or you can head over to Aji Tapa Bar & Restaurant at Bella Vista Resort, our sister property and use the kayaks, swim off ",210934594,Pur,21/08/18,"San Pedro, Belize",N/A,N/A,N/A,,19,20,t,"San Pedro, Corozal District, Belize",Belize Islands,Belize,17.939627473544995,-87.94982097,Room in boutique hotel,Private room,2,1,1,1,"[""Outdoor furniture"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Mini fridge"", ""Hammock"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Conditioner"", ""Self check-in"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Shampoo"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Refrigerator"", ""First aid kit"", ""Dining table"", ""Outdoor shower"", ""Single level home"", ""Bikes"", ""Building staff"", ""Resort view"", ""Beach essentials"", ""38 inch HDTV with standard cable"", ""Wifi"", ""Free street parking"", ""Garden view"", ""Shared outdoor pool - available all year, open 24 hours, pool toys"", ""Iron"", ""Courtyard view"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Shower gel"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hangers"", ""Beach access \u2013 Beachfront"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""AC - split type ductless system"", ""Pool view"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Coffee"", ""Body soap"", ""Shared backyard \u2013 Fully fenced"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Resort access"", ""Safe"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Children\u2019s dinnerware"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Essentials"", ""Ceiling fan"", ""Long term stays allowed""]",$463.00,1,365,1,t,5,7,21,266,26,11,1,03/10/22,05/12/24,4.88,4.85,4.73,t,10,0,10,0,0.95

You can see the beach from the pool and it is one of the most tranquil places I have ever been.

You can get here from the mainland either via an 15 minute flight or a 90 minute boat trip.<br /><br />San Pedro is a quaint little town of about 18,000 residents that has retained its charm while handling the growing number of visitors. Sea Haven Beach House is located 5 miles/8 km south of the town core, which means you are away from the crowds yet still within reach of everything. [Note that when coming from/to town, the road is hard packed sand for about 3 miles.]<br /><br />Town is not far away when you want to go in for some live music, shopping, restaurants, etc. But there are things relatively close by too, such as:<br />-Playa de Sala rooftop bar & restaurant: 1.5 mile<br />-Stax Container Bar: 1.5 mile<br />-Pelican Reef Grill, Happy's Tequilaria, Black Orchid Restaurants & the Hula Bar: ~2.5 miles<br />-Marin’s, a small grocery store: ~2.5 miles<br /><br />The Belize Barrier Reef, the longest i",1120393,Barbara,06/09/11,United States,within an hour,87%,92%,t,29,67,f,"San Pedro, Corozal District, Belize",Belize Islands,Belize,17.877912643770223,-88.01056601,Entire home,Entire home/apt,4,2.5,2,2,"[""Outdoor furniture"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Hot water"", ""Backyard"", ""Hammock"", ""Kayak"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Conditioner"", ""Oven"", ""Fire pit"", ""Host greets you"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Shampoo"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Waterfront"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib"", ""Dining table"", ""Toaster"", ""Outdoor shower"", ""Single level home"", ""Pool"", ""TV"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Beach essentials"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Wifi"", ""Bed linens"", ""Blender"", ""Microwave"", ""Sun loungers"", ""Iron"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Housekeeping - available at extra cost"", ""Hangers"", ""Private entrance"", ""Freezer"", ""Dishwasher"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Body soap"", ""Dryer"", ""Safe"", ""Washer"", ""Kitchen"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Stove"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Essentials"", ""Boat slip"", ""Ceiling fan""]",$686.00,3,30,3,t,13,24,39,115,0,0,0,,,,,,f,26,26,0,0,

It is very quiet and beautiful.  You can arrange for groceries and take out to be delivered on days you just don't feel like leaving the condos.  Truely a place to kick back and relax.  We do highly recommend that you rent a golf cart or bikes.  Another option would be using taxis.  This is an eco friendly area and this community is all off grid.
